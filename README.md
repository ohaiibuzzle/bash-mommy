# bash-mommy
Yet another [Gankra/cargo-mommy](https://github.com/Gankra/cargo-mommy) implementation. 

Inspired by [sudofox/shell-mommy](https://github.com/sudofox/shell-mommy).

I mainly wanted to add the ability to fetch responses directly from the upstream so I can have the more *wild* options there

## Requirements
- `curl` and `sed` should absolutely be installed
- `jq` may be installed but if not, should be fetched automatically using 1bin's binaries

## Installation
If you just want `mommy` in your shell when you want it, simply source `mommy.sh`

```bash
$ source mommy.sh
$ mommy false
don't forget to hydrate~ ðŸ’–
```

If you are more deranged, use `PROMPT_COMMAND`
```bash
$ source mommy.sh
$ export PROMPT_COMMAND="mommy \\$\\(exit \$?\\); $PROMPT_COMMAND"
$ false
it's ok, mommy's here for you~ ðŸ’–
```

## Configuration
The following settings are available to you:

- `BASH_MOMMY_MOOD`: `chill`, `omnious`, `thirsty` or `yikes`. Defaults to `chill`
- `BASH_MOMMY_PRONOUN`: Defaults to `her`
- `BASH_MOMMY_ROLE`: Defaults to `mommy`
- `BASH_MOMMY_AFFECTIONATE_TERM`: Defaults to `girl`

The following only becomes available if `BASH_MOMMY_MOOD` is `yikes`
- `BASH_MOMMY_PART`
- `BASH_MOMMY_DENIGRATING_TERM`

(You can figure them out yourself)
